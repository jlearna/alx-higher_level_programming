### Python - if/else, loops, functions
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language: if/elif/else loops, range, ord(), chr(),
>  modulo, copy of string, bytecode

### Description of what each file shows:
* Files that start with: (all python scripts execpt #13)
0. print whether the random number is positive or negative
1. print the last digit of the number stored in prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new linvariable
2. prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
3. prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
4. prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
5. prints numbers from 0 to 99
6. prints all possible different combinations of two digits
7. function that checks for lowercase character
9. function that prints the last digit of a number
10. function that print a string in uppercase followed by a new line
91. function that computes a to the power of b and return the value
12. function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space - FizzBuzz
13. function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
100. prints the alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line
101. function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”)
102. Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
